grade = "C"

if grade == "A"
  puts "Daddy will be happy"
elsif grade == "B"
  puts "Daddy will a little disappointed, but be okay"
else
  puts "Daddy will be sad"  
end

# else is kinda like a default. It guarantees some logic wil run, as opposed to a chain of elsif where code will only run if a condition is met that is evaluated as true
